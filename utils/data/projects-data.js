With features like role-based access, real-time status tracking, and automated notifications, the system ensures transparency, accountability, and quicker resolutions. Built using React, Node.js, FastAPI and MongoDB, it provides a secure and user-friendly interface that makes grievance management efficient and traceable.",

        description: 'Event Revolution is a Web3-native event platform I built to turn real-world event recognition into digital assets with long-term value. Instead of just awarding winners with physical prizes or certificates, the platform lets organizers mint NFTs as trophies, representing the winner\'s achievement on-chain. These NFTs are not just symbolic — they’re tokenized, fractionally ownable, and made available for the public to buy into, creating a community-driven way to invest in talent and memorable moments. Built using Next.js, Ethers.js, and smart contracts, the platform supports wallet-based login, on-chain reward distribution, and dynamic token sales, turning events into launchpads for creators and communities alike.',

Designers can mint original or remixable fashion NFTs, register them as IP assets, attach programmable licenses, and mint license tokens that grant usage rights. Built with Next.js, wagmi, Viem, and the Story Protocol Core SDK, the platform manages the full IP lifecycle—from creation and attribution to licensing and monetization—entirely on-chain, with a smooth UX and decentralized storage via IPFS.',
