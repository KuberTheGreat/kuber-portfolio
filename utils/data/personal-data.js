  description: "Hey, I’m Kuber — a full-stack dev building across Web2 and Web3. I love crafting clean, user-focused apps and experimenting with smart contracts, NFTs, and on-chain IP. I’ve won hackathons like the Hackofiesta 6.1 for projects around DeFi, digital fashion, and remixable design systems. Whether it’s launching a dApp or designing a protocol, I’m all about shipping fast, learning constantly, and having fun with the process.",
